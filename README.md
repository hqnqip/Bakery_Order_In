# Bakery_Order_In
Decription: 
My program is a simulation about ordering at a bakery. The user (or player) is
the customer, while the program is more or less a waiter. When running, the
program (prints) greets the customer and shows an open table. Then, it prints the
entire menu that the customer can choose from. Based on what the customer types as
input, the waiter informs if the food item is available and/or asks following questions 
regarding order accommodations (depending on Food type: Drink, Sandwich, Cake). Based on
further customer input, the cost of the order changes. By the end, there is a random 
event that prints whether or not the waiter drops the customer's order. If it dropped, 
the customer is compensated. Otherwise, the bill is printed out.

How to Begin:
Click "Run" or a green pointing-right arrow. 
Then, follow the prompts and type when told.

Special Features:
1. Japanese emoticons are included with a few printed messages. ٩(＾◡＾)۶
2. Rather than simply taking the number of fluid ounces for a drink,
the waiter calculates an accurate number of cups needed. :)
3. The waiter allows for another consideration if a type of cake is not available.
4. If an inaccurate choice is made, the waiter will happily serve their recommended item.
5. Some people may want their sandwich bread-only.
6. In some other cases, the waiter may add every component to the sandwich. :P
7. Milk tea is intentionally made the most expensive item, because boba is expensive
in real life.
