# Bakery_Order_In
Decription: 
My program is a simulation about ordering at a bakery. The user (or player) is
the customer, while the program is more or less a waiter. When running, the
program (prints) greets the customer and shows an open table. Then, it prints the
entire menu that the customer can choose from. Based on what the customer types as
input, the waiter informs if the food item is available and/or asks following questions 
regarding order accommodations (depending on Food type: Drink, Sandwich, Cake).
